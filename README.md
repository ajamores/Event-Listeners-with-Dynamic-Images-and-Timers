# Event-Listeners-with-Dynamic-Images-and-Timers

A simple JavaScript application that allows users to interact with dynamically generated images and a countdown timer. This project uses event listeners and dynamic updates to give users an engaging and interactive experience.

## Key Concepts Learned

  - Using addEventListener to bind event handlers to elements
  - Accessing and manipulating the DOM using JavaScript
  - Dynamically updating and changing images using an array
  - Creating and updating a countdown timer using setInterval
  - Using ternary operators to switch between default and user input values
  - Validating user input to ensure it falls within an acceptable range

# Features

  - Randomize Button: Generates a new set of three images based on the arrays in the JavaScript code.
  - Image Interaction: Allows users to click on an image to randomly generate a new image from the corresponding array.
  - Countdown Timer: A timer that counts down from 12 seconds by default or from a user-inputted value if entered.
  - Background Color Changes: Changes the background color of the timer at every third of its countdown.
